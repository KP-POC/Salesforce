# Lightning Controllers

```handleClick: function(component, event, helper) {```
* Always declare your controller functions to take these three parameters.
    * component—the component. In this case, it’s helloMessageInteractive.
    * event—the event that caused the action handler to be called.
    * helper—the component’s helper, another JavaScript resource of reusable functions.
