# Salesforce DevOps

### Continuous Integration (CI) 
Software Development practice in which developers regularly integrate their code changes into a source code
repository. To ensure that the new code does not introduce bugs, automated builds and tests run before or after
developers check in their changes. The goal of CI is to provide rapid feedback so that when defects are introduced
into the code base, they are identified and corrected as soon as possible.

CI = Automated Version Control + Automated Testing + Automated Deployments + Document Trail

### Continuous Delivery (CD) 
Software Development practice in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can
be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently.

### Continuous Deployment 
Continuous Deployment means that every change is automatically deployed to production. Continuous Delivery
means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually
due to business reasons. In order to do continuous deployment, one must be doing continuous delivery.
