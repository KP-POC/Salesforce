# Salesforce DevOps

### Continuous Integration (CI) 
Software Development practice in which developers regularly integrate their code changes into a source code
repository. To ensure that the new code does not introduce bugs, automated builds and tests run before or after
developers check in their changes. The goal of CI is to provide rapid feedback so that when defects are introduced
into the code base, they are identified and corrected as soon as possible

CI = Automated Version Control + Automated Testing + Automated Deployments + Document Trail
