# Salesforce REST API
A REST resource is an abstraction of a piece of information or an action, such as a single data record, a collection of records, or a query. Each resource in REST API is identified by a named Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and is accessed using standard HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). REST API is based on the usage of resources, their URIs, and the links between them.

## REST Resources and Methods
A REST resource is an abstraction of a piece of information or an action, such as a single data record, a collection of records, or a query. Each resource in REST API is identified by a named Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and is accessed using standard HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). REST API is based on the usage of resources, their URIs, and the links between them.

A REST request consists of four components: a resource URI, an HTTP method, request headers, and a request body. Request headers specify metadata for the request. The request body specifies data for the request, when necessary. If thereâ€™s no data to specify, the body is omitted from the request.
