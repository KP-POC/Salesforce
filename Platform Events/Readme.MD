With platform events, you can monitor your systems and communicate changes to other systems.
* Event-based communication revolves around a publisher-subscriber modelâ€”a sender broadcasts a message that one or more receivers capture.
* Platform events enable the flow of event messages within Salesforce and to or from external apps. Apps on the Salesforce platform use an Apex method to publish events and an Apex trigger to consume events. 
* external apps publish events using the sObject API and consume events using CometD clients.
