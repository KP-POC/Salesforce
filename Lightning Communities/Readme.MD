# Napili
Customer Service (Napili) template includes the following theme layouts and types:
* The Inner type applies the Customer Service theme layout to all pages, except the login pages.
* The Login type applies Login Body Layout to the login pages.
* The Home type isn’t applied to any pages. However, it’s ideal for applying a separate theme layout when you want your home page to look different from the inner pages in your community.

To build theme layouts for use in Community Builder, you create custom theme layout components in the Developer Console by implementing the `forceCommunity:themeLayout` interface.
