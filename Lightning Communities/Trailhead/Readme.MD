# Code Highlights
* To appear in Community Builder in the Settings | Theme area, a theme layout component must implement the forceCommunity:themeLayout interface.
* Add {!v.body} wherever you want the content, which changes from page to page, to appear within the theme layout.
* Attributes declared as Aura.Component[] and included in your markup are rendered in the theme layout as open regions, which form the basic structure of your theme layout. Users can add drag-and-drop components to these regions in Community Builder.
* The code uses the SLDS grid system to add structure to the layout.
* Extending the abstract forceCommunity:navigationMenuBase component gives the new component automatic access to all the navigation menu items defined in the communityâ€™s Navigation Menu component. Admins can define and update the items in the Navigation Menu in Community Builder.
* To show the menu in action, this simple unordered list iterates through an array of menuItems, which is defined in the extended abstract component, and outputs <li> for each entry in the array.
